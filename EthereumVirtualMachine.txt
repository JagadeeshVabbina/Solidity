The Ethereum Virtual Machine
* Runs on every full Node.
* Processes transactions and perform state change deterministically.
* is Turing complete
* State changes as part of consensus.

Pros and Cons:-
- :- EVM is slow,inclusion vs performance,10-20 transactions per second
+ :-  Permissionless,Trustless/Verifiable,Distributed/VeryRobust and Irreversible
