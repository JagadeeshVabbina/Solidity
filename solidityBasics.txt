major,minor,patch

Storing data on-chain:-
0 to 2**256 - 1 slots(each has 32byte size)

Private does not mean that variable is hidden.

virtual and override

special modifiers for variables:-
constant and immutable :- disallow of chaning the value of variable during the lifetime of contract
Difference:- immutable can be set during contract deployment.

block.basefee
block.chainid

uint amount = 1 ether;
assert(amount == 1e18);

wei(1),gwei(10**9),ether(10**18)

Time suffixes:- seconds,minutes,hours,days,weeks
uint twoHours = 2 hours;
assert(twoHours == 2 * 60 * 60);

uint numofHrs = 2;
uint twoHours = numofHrs hours; //not allowed
uint tqoHours = numofHrs * 1 hours;
