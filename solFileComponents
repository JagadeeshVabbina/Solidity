Miners:- Mine new blocks with new transactions and write this block to Ethereum Ledger
advertise and send a newly mined block to other miners
accept the newly mined blocks by other miners and keep their own ledger instance up to date .

POS:- a minimum of 32 ETH is required to stake. then at random the network will choose a validator to create a new block at every epoch.

Ethereum Nodes:-
• The EVM
• Mining nodes (Ethereum 1.0)
• Validators (Ethereum 2.0)

Externally owned accounts :- Private/Public key
Contract Address :- only Public Key
===========================================================
solidity primary purpose is to write smart contracts for Ethereum Blockchain.
solidity is statically typed ,case sensitive and High level object oriented programming language.
statement terminator is semicolon ;
Current compiler version is 0.8.17
0.8 is called major build and 17 is called minor build.usually breaking changes will be there in major version.
EVM is the runtime environment for smart contracts and DApps(Decentralised Apps).

SolidityCode --> solidity Compiler(Solc) -->bytecode&ABI --> Deployed & Executed on EVM.
ABI is Application binary interface which means all the external and public function declaration along with its parameters and return types.


solidity file components:-
1.pragma
2.comments
3.import.
4.contract/library/interface

1.pragma:- it is a language construct . the following is the syntax.
//SPDX-License-Identifie: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17 //pragma solidity <<version>> ^ caret denoted from 0.8.17 to 0.9.0 but excluding 0.9.0
it is better to define a particular compiler version in order to prevent the breaking changes issues.

2.comments
//single line comments
/* Hello There smart contract developer
Ethereum blockchain
Vitalik buterin */
/// I am a blockchain developer
/** @author ArjunJagadeesh
    @title smart contract for a bank
	@dev it stores bank emp details\
	@param _name emp name
	@param _age emp age param should is case sensitive 
	*/


3.import 
import keyword helps to use a code from a different solidity file.following syntax
import 'FirstContract.sol';

. means same directory
.. parent directory
/ means path of directories same like windows and Linux Operating systems.

4.contract/Library/interaface
Apart from pragma,comments,import, we can declare contract/library/interface at global level.Multiple contracts/libraries/interfaces can be declared within a single solidity file.
