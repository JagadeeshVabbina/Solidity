Address 20 bytes long
0.4.18 function name same as contract name becomes constructor :-


variable - storage,memory and calldata
state variables are stored in Ethereum storage(Smart contracts)
two types of functions 1. creates a transaction(Setter)
                                      2. No Transaction(Getter)
view:- only read the state of the blockchain , cant change
pure:- cant read , cant change the state of the blockchain

two ways to return variabel :- 1. write your own function
                                                 2. Let solidity do it.

with IPFS --> can store data cheaply 

** Location has to be memory for publicly visible functions
=================================================================
functions
* change the state variable/create a transaction/read the state vars from ethereum blockchain
=============================================================================================
Decentralization:- The App/service will be deployed on the Network, even if one server crashed The service will be available
                  ie No single server has ABSOLUTE CONTROL rather every server will have copy of current data and EXECUTION LOGIC.
				  
Distributed:- Each server will have many to many connections with each other rather than one to many or many to one  
              connections

Database:- Storing record of transactions

Ledger:- APPEND-ONLY ; existing tranasctions cant be modified(Immutability) but data can be modified by new transactions.

Asymmetric cryptography:- two keys for encryption and decryption 

*** Nodes use port 30303 for peer to peer communication.
