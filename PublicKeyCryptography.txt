Public and Private key pair is an digital validation process of ownership and authentication.

For Every private key, there will be an associated corresponding public key .

Whenever we initiate a transaction or communication.. the value will be signed with a private key and it will generate a signed signature message...and it will be decrypted only by using the corresponding public key...so in the end it can be verified that this particular transaction/message was originated by the particular indivisual/organization who has the private key.
