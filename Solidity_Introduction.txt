* Solidity is a High level programming language and is heavily influenced by C++,Python and Javascript.
* it is curly braced language.
* Solidity is designed to target Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM).
*Solidity is used to create Smart contract which govern the state of accounts within Etherum blockchain.
*it is a statistically typed ,support inheritance and user defined variables.
*it is proposed in 2014 by Gavin Wood of Polkadot and  the language was later developed by the Ethereum project's Solidity team, led by Christian Reitwiessner.

The Life Cycle of a Smart Contract:-

The developers will create smart contracts in High level programming languages like solidity or Vyper or serpent, then that code is compiled ,the compilation process will generate two seperate components.
1.Byte Code
2.ABI

* Byte code is the output of the compilation process, which EVM understands in order.

*ABI is Application Binary interface which allows outside accounts interact with the smart contract features.
