EIP-1559 , London fork ,05 Aug 2021

mainly solves the gas fee volatility and along with other key issues .

Before EIP-1559 :- gasUint * gasPrice --> miner's address

After EIP-1559 :- Base fee(-/+ 12.5% block) and priority fee and Max fee
                           * base fee is set by the Protocol

base fee:- The minimum is which is required to initate the transaction. it will be burned.
priority fee:- its a tip to the miner/validator to include in the block
max fee:- maximum gas price user is willing to pay for one unit of gas. transaction remains penidng if base fee > Max fee

Refund:- max(0, maxfee-(basefee+ maxpriorityFee) is refunded to the user after execution.


if a transaction is struct becuase lesser base fee, can inlcude a new transaction with the same nonce if the newer one is executed successfully, the previous one will be rejected.
